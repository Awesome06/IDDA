    "summary": "**Business-Friendly Summary:**\n\nThis 'order_items' table/view contains information about the individual items ordered by customers, including the order ID, item ID, product ID, quantity, list price, and discount applied to each item. This data represents the details of a customer's shopping cart or purchase order.\n\n**Use Case:**\n\nA business analyst would analyze this data to gain insights into customer purchasing behavior, identify trends in product demand, and optimize pricing strategies. For example, by analyzing the 'discount' column, a business could determine which products are most frequently discounted and adjust their promotions accordingly to boost sales.",
    "schema_explanation": "Let's break down the \"order_items\" table/view into understandable pieces.\n\nThe \"order_items\" table is like a ledger that keeps track of individual items purchased as part of an order. Imagine you're shopping online, and your cart contains multiple items. This table would store each item separately, along with some important details about it.\n\nHere's what the columns mean:\n\n* `order_id`: A unique identifier for the order that this item belongs to. Think of it like a file folder label.\n* `item_id`: A unique identifier for each individual item within an order. This is like assigning a name tag to each item in your cart.\n* `product_id`: This links back to another table or view called \"products\" (not shown here), which contains information about the product itself, such as its name, description, and price. It's like a reference card that says what kind of product this is.\n* `quantity`: The number of items purchased in this particular order. For example, if you ordered 3 units of a product, this column would show \"3\".\n* `list_price`: The original price of the product before any discounts or promotions were applied. It's like the sticker price on a store shelf.\n* `discount`: Any discount that was given for this item in this order. This could be a percentage off or a flat amount taken off the list price.\n\nThe relationships between columns are straightforward:\n\n* An `order_id` links to an order, which might contain multiple items (other rows with the same `order_id`).\n* An `item_id` uniquely identifies each individual item within an order.\n* A `product_id` connects back to the \"products\" table/view, providing context about what kind of product this is.\n\nThis schema could be used in various e-commerce scenarios, such as:\n\n1. Order processing: When a customer places an order, this table would store each item purchased, along with relevant details like quantity and discount.\n2. Inventory management: By tracking `product_id`s and quantities, you can monitor stock levels and ensure that products are not over- or under-stocked.\n3. Reporting and analytics: This table provides a detailed breakdown of individual items within an order, making it easier to analyze sales trends and customer behavior.\n\nOverall, the \"order_items\" schema is designed to provide a clear picture of what was purchased in each order, allowing for efficient processing, analysis, and decision-making in e-commerce environments.",
