    "summary": "**Business Friendly Summary:**\nThe 'categories' table/view contains information about different types of bicycles, categorized based on their characteristics. This data provides a comprehensive overview of the bicycle categories offered by an e-commerce platform or a retail store.\n\n**Use Case:**\nA business may analyze this data to understand customer preferences and buying patterns for different types of bicycles. For instance, they might want to identify which category (e.g., Children Bicycles or Electric Bikes) is most popular among their customers, allowing them to inform product development, marketing strategies, and inventory management decisions that cater to those categories' needs.",
    "schema_explanation": "Let's break down the technical schema of the \"categories\" table/view into simpler terms.\n\nThe \"categories\" table has two columns: `category_id` and `category_name`. Think of it like a list of categories, like categories for books or online courses.\n\n* The `category_id` is like a unique identifier or code for each category. It's an integer (int64) that helps keep track of individual categories.\n* The `category_name` is the actual name of the category, like \"Science Fiction\" or \"Cooking\". It's stored as a string (str), which means it can contain letters, numbers, and special characters.\n\nNow, let's talk about relationships between columns. Since each category has its own unique ID, you could use that ID to link it to other related categories or even individual items within those categories. For example:\n\n* You might have another table called \"books\" with a `category_id` column that links each book to one of the categories in this \"categories\" table.\n* Similarly, if you had an e-commerce website with products, you could use the `category_id` to link each product to its corresponding category (e.g., \"Electronics\" or \"Home Goods\").\n\nThis schema is useful for organizing and categorizing data, which can help with tasks like:\n\n* Creating filters or menus on websites\n* Grouping similar items together in a database or inventory system\n* Tracking user preferences or interests based on the categories they choose\n\nIn summary, the \"categories\" table has two columns: `category_id` (unique identifier) and `category_name` (actual category name). This schema is useful for organizing data and linking it to other related information.",
