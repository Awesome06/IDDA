    "summary": "**Business-Friendly Summary**\n\nThe 'products' dataset contains information about various bicycles, including their product names, brands, categories, model years, and list prices. This data provides insights into the products offered by different bicycle manufacturers, categorized by type, and can be used to inform business decisions related to product development, marketing, and sales.\n\n**Use Case**\n\nA business would analyze this dataset to gain a deeper understanding of their product offerings and competitors in the market. By analyzing the 'products' table, a company could identify trends and patterns in their own products, such as which brands or categories are most popular, and use this information to inform product development, pricing strategies, and marketing campaigns. For example, if a company notices that their Trek-branded products are consistently outperforming other brands, they may want to invest more resources into developing new Trek products or emphasizing the brand's strengths in their marketing efforts.",
    "schema_explanation": "The \"products\" table is like an electronic catalog that stores information about different products, such as their names, details, and characteristics. Let me break it down for you:\n\n* 'product_id' (int64): This is a unique identifier for each product, like a special code that tells us which product we're talking about. Think of it like a social security number for products!\n* 'product_name' (str): This column stores the actual name of the product, like \"iPhone 13\" or \"Nike Air Jordan\".\n* 'brand_id' (int64): This column links each product to its respective brand, like Apple or Nike. It's like a reference key that says, \"Hey, this iPhone is made by Apple!\"\n* 'category_id' (int64): This column categorizes each product into groups, such as Electronics, Clothing, or Home Goods. It helps us quickly find products within a specific category.\n* 'model_year' (int64): This column stores the year when the product was first introduced, like 2020 for an iPhone 13.\n* 'list_price' (float64): This column shows the original price of the product, including any discounts or promotions.\n\nNow, let's talk about relationships between columns:\n\n* The 'brand_id' and 'category_id' columns are connected because a brand can belong to multiple categories (e.g., Apple makes iPhones, Watches, and Computers). Think of it like a family tree, where brands have many products under their umbrella!\n* The 'model_year' column is related to the 'product_name' because each product has its own unique characteristics based on when it was released. For example, an iPhone 13 from 2020 will be different from an iPhone 14 from 2022.\n\nOverall, this \"products\" table provides a way for us to organize and manage information about various products, making it easier to find specific details or group similar items together.",
