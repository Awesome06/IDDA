    "schema_explanation": "Let's break down the technical schema of the \"products\" table/view:\n\n**Columns:**\n\n1. **product_id**: This is a unique identifier for each product, like a special code that distinguishes it from other products. It's an integer value (int64).\n2. **product_name**: This column stores the actual name of the product, such as \"Apple iPhone 13\" or \"Nike Air Jordan\". The data type is string (str).\n3. **brand_id**: This column links each product to a specific brand, like Apple or Nike. It's another integer value (int64) that can be used to connect products to their respective brands.\n4. **category_id**: Similar to the brand_id, this column assigns each product to a specific category, such as \"smartphones\" or \"shoes\". Again, it's an integer value (int64).\n5. **model_year**: This column stores the year of release for each product model, like 2022 or 2018. It's an integer value (int64) that can be used to track when a new product was introduced.\n6. **list_price**: This column contains the original retail price at which the product was initially sold. The data type is floating-point number (float64), which allows for decimal values.\n\n**Relationships between columns:**\n\n* **brand_id** and **category_id**: These two columns have a many-to-one relationship, meaning that each brand can have multiple products in different categories, but each product belongs to only one category.\n* **model_year**: This column is related to the product's history, allowing you to track when new models were introduced.\n\n**What does this schema mean?**\n\nIn simple terms, this \"products\" table/view stores information about various items (products) with unique characteristics. The schema provides a way to organize and connect different aspects of each product, such as its name, brand, category, release year, and original price.\n\nPotential use cases for this schema include:\n\n* E-commerce platforms: This schema could be used to manage products on an online store, allowing customers to search, filter, and purchase items based on their characteristics.\n* Product databases: The schema can be employed in product databases or catalogs that require detailed information about various products.\n* Market research: Analysts can use this schema to study market trends, track changes in product offerings over time, and analyze consumer behavior.\n\nIn summary, the \"products\" table/view provides a robust framework for storing and managing data about different types of products. The schema's relationships between columns enable you to explore connections between products, brands, categories, and release years, making it a valuable asset for various industries and applications.",
