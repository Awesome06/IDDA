    "summary": "**Business-Friendly Summary:**\nThe 'stocks' table provides information on the current inventory levels of various products across different stores. Each row represents a specific product stored at a particular store, with the quantity column indicating the number of units available.\n\n**Use Case:**\nA business would analyze this data to optimize their supply chain management and ensure accurate forecasting for future orders. For example, by analyzing the 'quantity' column, they can identify slow-moving products or overstocked items that may require adjustments in inventory levels or pricing strategies to maintain optimal stock levels and minimize waste.",
    "schema_explanation": "The \"stocks\" table is like a digital warehouse where you keep track of how many items of each type you have available for sale at your stores.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n* 'store_id' (an integer): This column keeps track of which store the item belongs to. Think of it like a unique identifier for each store.\n* 'product_id' (an integer): This column is like a serial number for each product. It tells you which specific product this quantity of stock is related to.\n* 'quantity' (an integer): This column shows how many units of that product are currently in stock at the specified store.\n\nNow, let's talk relationships:\n\n* Each product has a unique ID ('product_id'), so you can easily look up information about a particular product across all your stores.\n* Each store also has its own unique ID ('store_id'), making it easy to track inventory levels and sales for each location separately.\n* The 'quantity' column is tied to both the store and product IDs, giving you a snapshot of how much stock you have at each store for each specific product.\n\nPotential use cases:\n\n* Inventory management: You can use this table to keep track of your stock levels across different stores. This helps you make informed decisions about restocking or transferring products between locations.\n* Sales analysis: By combining the 'stocks' data with sales data, you can analyze which products are selling well at each store and adjust your inventory accordingly.\n* Store performance tracking: You can use this table to monitor the overall performance of each store by comparing stock levels and sales data.\n\nIn summary, the \"stocks\" table is a centralized hub for managing product inventory across multiple stores. It provides valuable insights into what's available in stock at each location, helping you optimize your business operations and make informed decisions about sales and restocking.",
