    "summary": "**Business-Friendly Summary:**\nThe 'stocks' table provides a snapshot of the current inventory levels across different stores, broken down by product. This data is essential for understanding the overall stock situation, identifying trends, and making informed decisions about stocking levels, reordering, and supply chain optimization.\n\n**Use Case:**\nA business analyst at a retail company would analyze this 'stocks' table to identify patterns in sales and inventory trends across different stores. For example, if they notice that Store 1 has consistently low stock levels for Product 2, they could use this information to inform ordering decisions and ensure timely restocking, ultimately driving revenue growth and improving customer satisfaction.",
    "schema_explanation": "Let's break down the technical schema of the \"stocks\" table/view.\n\nThe \"stocks\" table contains information about the products that are currently stored in various stores. It has three columns:\n\n* \"store_id\": This column is an integer that represents a unique identifier for each store where the product is stored.\n* \"product_id\": This column is also an integer that uniquely identifies each product being stored.\n* \"quantity\": This column is an integer that shows how many units of the product are currently in stock at each store.\n\nFrom this schema, we can infer some relationships between columns:\n\n* Each product (identified by \"product_id\") has multiple entries in the table, one for each store where it's stocked. In other words, there's a many-to-many relationship between products and stores.\n* Each store (identified by \"store_id\") also has multiple entries in the table, one for each product it stocks.\n\nThis schema suggests that you can use this data to answer questions like:\n\n* What products are available at which stores?\n* How many units of a specific product are stocked at a particular store?\n* Which stores stock a certain product?\n\nSome potential use cases for this schema include:\n\n* Inventory management: Use the \"quantity\" column to track how much of each product is in stock, and update it as orders are fulfilled or new shipments arrive.\n* Supply chain optimization: Analyze the data to identify which products are most popular at certain stores, and adjust inventory accordingly.\n* Store planning: Use the data to determine which products should be stocked at different locations based on local demand.\n\nOverall, this schema provides a solid foundation for managing and analyzing product inventory across multiple stores.",
