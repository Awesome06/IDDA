    "schema_explanation": "Let's break down the technical schema of the 'staffs' table/view into simpler terms.\n\nThe 'staffs' table appears to be a list of employees or staff members working for an organization. Here's what each column represents:\n\n* **Staff ID (staff_id):** A unique numerical identifier assigned to each staff member, similar to a Social Security number.\n* **First Name (first_name):** The staff member's first name.\n* **Last Name (last_name):** The staff member's last name.\n* **Email (email):** The staff member's email address.\n* **Phone (phone):** The staff member's phone number.\n* **Active (active):** A boolean value indicating whether the staff member is currently employed or not. Think of it like a \"yes\" or \"no\" answer to the question, \"Is this staff member active?\"\n* **Store ID (store_id):** This column likely links each staff member to a specific store or location where they work.\n* **Manager ID (manager_id):** This column suggests that some staff members have a manager, which could be another staff member.\n\nNow, let's talk about relationships between columns:\n\nThe **Store ID** links each staff member to a specific store. For example, Staff A might work at Store 1, while Staff B works at Store 2.\n\nThe **Manager ID** suggests that some staff members have a direct supervisor or manager. For instance, Staff C has Manager X as their supervisor.\n\nThese relationships can be useful in various scenarios:\n\n* To find all the staff members working at a specific store.\n* To identify which staff member is responsible for managing a particular team.\n* To track who reports to whom in an organizational hierarchy.\n\nIn summary, the 'staffs' table provides a comprehensive overview of employees or staff members, including their basic information, employment status, and relationships with stores and managers.",
